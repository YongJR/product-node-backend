## CRUD Node.js Express.js MongoDB Backend 🧑🏻‍💻

### Overview

This project is a backend application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. The project demonstrates the implementation of RESTful API principles and serves as a practical exploration of backend development with these technologies.

### Technologies Used

-   Node.js
-   Express.js
-   MongoDB
-   Mongoose 
-   JavaScript (ES6+)


### Learning Objectives

Throughout the development of this application, key concepts and skills were acquired:

-   **RESTful API Design**: Understand the principles of RESTful API design and how to structure endpoints for CRUD operations.
-   **Express Framework**: Gain familiarity with Express, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
-   **MongoDB Integration**: Learn how to integrate MongoDB with a Node.js application using Mongoose for object data modeling.
-   **Asynchronous Programming**: Explore asynchronous programming in JavaScript using Promises and async/await.

### Features

-   **CRUD Operations**: Provide endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in a MongoDB database.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to ensure API reliability.
